==== Building the Documentation

Following command is used to build the document in the repo's root folder.

----
./gradlew build
----

==== Where Are the Generated Documents

The resulting documents can be found in `build/asciidoc/`.

==== How to Produce Different Output Formats

In the file `build.gradle`, you will see the "backends" tag:

----
backends = [ 'html5', /*'pdf',*/ /* 'multipage_html5',*/ /*'epub3'*/ ]
----

In this line, you can comment out (using `/\*` and `*/`) the formats that you do not want the generator to produce.

==== How to Add a New Chapter

In the file `build.gradle`, you will see the "sources" tag:

----
sources {
    include 'index.adoc'
}
----

The file `index.adoc` is the one which includes the chapters in the given order and also some parameters. It is located in the folder `src/docs/asciidocs/`.

When you want to add a new chapter, just create a text file (the extension of the file must be `adoc`) in the folder `src/docs/asciidocs/` and add the name of the file to `index.adoc`.

==== AsciiDoc?
