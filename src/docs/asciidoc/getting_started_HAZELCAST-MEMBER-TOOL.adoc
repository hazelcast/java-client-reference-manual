== Getting Started

This chapter explains how to install Hazelcast and start a Hazelcast member and client. It describes the executable files in the download package and also provides the fundamentals for configuring Hazelcast and its deployment options.

[[installation]]
=== Installation

The following sections explain the installation of Hazelcast IMDG and Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. It also includes notes and changes to consider when upgrading Hazelcast.

[[installing-hazelcast-imdg]]
==== Installing Hazelcast IMDG

You can find Hazelcast in standard Maven repositories. If your project uses Maven, you do not need to add
additional repositories to your `pom.xml` or add `hazelcast-<version>.jar` file into your
classpath (Maven does that for you). Just add the following lines to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
      <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
      <version>Hazelcast IMDG Version To Be Installed</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

As an alternative, you can download and install Hazelcast IMDG yourself. You only need to:

* Download the package `hazelcast-<version>.zip` or `hazelcast-<version>.tar.gz` from https://hazelcast.org/download[hazelcast.org].
* Extract the downloaded `hazelcast-<version>.zip` or `hazelcast-<version>.tar.gz`.
* Add the file `hazelcast-<version>.jar` to your classpath.

[[installing-hazelcast-imdg-enterprise]]
==== Installing Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise

There are two Maven repositories defined for Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise:

```
<repository>
   <id>Hazelcast Private Snapshot Repository</id>
   <url>https://repository-hazelcast-l337.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
</repository>
<repository>
   <id>Hazelcast Private Release Repository</id>
   <url>https://repository-hazelcast-l337.forge.cloudbees.com/release/</url>
</repository>
```

Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise customers may also define dependencies, a sample of which is shown below.

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
   <artifactId>hazelcast-enterprise</artifactId>
   <version>Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Version To Be Installed</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
   <artifactId>hazelcast-enterprise-all</artifactId>
   <version>Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Version To Be Installed</version>
</dependency>
```

[[setting-the-license-key]]
==== Setting the License Key

Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise offers you two types of licenses: **Enterprise** and **Enterprise HD**. The supported features differ in your Hazelcast setup according to the license type you own.

* **Enterprise license**: In addition to the open source edition of Hazelcast, Enterprise features are the following:
** Security
** WAN Replication
** Clustered REST
** Clustered JMX
** Striim Hot Cache
** Rolling Upgrades
* **Enterprise HD license**: In addition to the Enterprise features, Enterprise HD features are the following:
** High-Density Memory Store
** Hot Restart Persistence


To use Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise, you need to set the provided license key using one of the configuration methods shown below.

NOTE: Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license keys are required only for members. You do not need to set a license key for your Java clients for which you want to use IMDG Enterprise features.

**Declarative Configuration:**

Add the below line to any place you like in the file `hazelcast.xml`. This XML file offers you a declarative way to configure your Hazelcast. It is included in the Hazelcast download package. When you extract the downloaded package, you will see the file `hazelcast.xml` under the `/bin` directory.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <license-key>Your Enterprise License Key</license-key>
  ...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration:**

Alternatively, you can set your license key programmatically as shown below.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setLicenseKey( "Your Enterprise License Key" );
----


**Spring XML Configuration:**

If you are using Spring with Hazelcast, then you can set the license key using the Spring XML schema, as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hz:config>
  ...
  <hz:license-key>Your Enterprise License Key</hz:license-key>
  ...
</hz:config>
----



**JVM System Property:**

As another option, you can set your license key using the below command (the "-D" command line option).

```
-Dhazelcast.enterprise.license.key=Your Enterprise License Key
```

[[license-key-format]]
===== License Key Format

License keys have the following format:

```
<Name of the Hazelcast edition>#<Count of the Members>#<License key>
```

The strings before the `<License key>` is the human readable part. You can use your license key with or without this human readable part. So, both the following example license keys are valid:

```
HazelcastEnterpriseHD#2Nodes#1q2w3e4r5t
```


```
1q2w3e4r5t
```

[[license-info]]
==== License Information

License information is available through the following Hazelcast APIs.

===== JMX

The MBean `HazelcastInstance.LicenseInfo` holds all the relative license details and can be accessed through Hazelcast's JMX port (if enabled).

- `maxNodeCountAllowed`: Maximum members allowed to form a cluster under the current license.
- `expiryDate`: Expiration date of the current license.
- `typeCode`: Type code of the current license.
- `type`: Type of the current license.
- `ownerEmail`: Email of the current licence's owner.
- `companyName`: Company name on the current license.

Following is the list of license `type`s and `typeCode`s:

```
MANAGEMENT_CENTER(1, "Management Center"),
ENTERPRISE(0, "Enterprise"),
ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_ONLY(2, "Enterprise only with security"),
ENTERPRISE_HD(3, "Enterprise HD"),
CUSTOM(4, "Custom");
```

===== REST


You can access the license details by issuing a `GET` request through the REST API (if enabled) on the `/license` resource, as shown below.


```
curl -v -X GET -H "Content-Type: text/plain" http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/licence
```

Its output is similar to the following:

```
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, GET is already inferred.
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5701 (#0)
> GET /hazelcast/licence HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5701
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: text/plain
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 105
<

licenseInfo{"expiryDate":1560380399161,"maxNodeCount":10,"type":-1,"companyName":"ExampleCompany","ownerEmail":"ExampleOwner"}

```

===== Logs

Besides the above approaches (JMX and REST) to access the license details, Hazelcast also starts to log a license information banner into the log files when the license expiration is approaching.

During the last two months prior to the expiration, this license information banner is logged daily, as a reminder to renew your license to avoid any interruptions. Once the expiration is due to a month, the frequency of logging this banner becomes hourly (instead of daily). Lastly, when the expiration is due in a week, this banner will be printed every 30 minutes.

NOTE: Similar alerts are also present on the Hazelcast Management Center.

The banner has the following format:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
HAZELCAST LICENSE WILL EXPIRE IN 29 DAYS.
Your Hazelcast cluster will stop working after this time.

Your license holder is customer@example-company.com, you should have them contact
our license renewal department, urgently on info@hazelcast.com
or call us on +1 (650) 521-5453

Please quote license id CUSTOM_TEST_KEY

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
```

WARNING: Please pay attention to the license warnings to prevent any possible interruptions in the operation of your Hazelcast applications.

NOTE: Hazelcast IMDG 3.10 and older releases are not fully tested on JDK 9 and newer, so there may be some features that are not working properly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
See the following sections for the details of Hazelcast IMDG supporting JDK 9 and newer:

* <<running-in-modular-java, Running in Modular Java>>: Talks about the new module system present in Java 9 and newer and how you can run a Hazelcast application on it.
* <<tls-ssl-for-hazelcast-members, TLS/SSL for Hazelcast Members>>: Lists `TLSv1.3`, which comes with Java 11, as a supported TLS version.
====

[[running-in-modular-java]]
=== Running in Modular Java

Java http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/[project Jigsaw] brought a new Module System into Java 9 and newer. Hazelcast supports running in the modular environment. If you want to run your application with Hazelcast libraries on the modulepath, use following module names:

* `com.hazelcast.core` for `hazelcast-<version>.jar` and `hazelcast-enterprise-<version>.jar`
* `com.hazelcast.client` for `hazelcast-client-<version>.jar` and `hazelcast-enterprise-client-<version>.jar`

Don't use `hazelcast-all-<version>.jar` or `hazelcast-enterprise-all-<version>.jar` on the modulepath as it could lead to problems in module dependencies for your application. You can still use them on the classpath.

The Java Module System comes with stricter visibility rules. It affects Hazelcast which uses internal Java API to reach the best performance results.

Hazelcast needs `java.se` module and access to the following Java packages for a proper work:

* `java.base/jdk.internal.ref`
* `java.base/java.nio` _(reflective access)_
* `java.base/sun.nio.ch` _(reflective access)_
* `java.base/java.lang` _(reflective access)_
* `jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal` _(reflective access)_
* `java.management/sun.management` _(reflective access)_

You can provide the access to the above mentioned packages by using `--add-exports` and `--add-opens` (for the reflective access) Java arguments.

**Example: Running a member on the classpath**

[source,bash]
----
java --add-modules java.se \
  --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED \
  -jar hazelcast-<version>.jar
----

**Example: Running a member on the modulepath**

[source,bash]
----
java --add-modules java.se \
  --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.ref=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/java.lang=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/java.nio=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.management/sun.management=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=com.hazelcast.core \
  --module-path lib \
  --module com.hazelcast.core/com.hazelcast.core.server.StartServer
----

_This example expects `hazelcast-<version>.jar` placed in the `lib` directory._

[[starting-the-member-and-client]]
=== Starting a Hazelcast Member

You can start Hazelcast members from the command line and hence create clusters using the `hazelcast-member` tool. It provides a simple and easy way to create Hazelcast clusters especially for your client/server type of deployments.

Run the following command, and a member with the default configuration will start:

```
hazelcast-member start
```

As soon as you run the above command, it shows you a name assigned to the process which corresponds to the newly started Hazelcast member. An example output is shown below:

```
john@Johns-MacBook-Pro:~/Desktop$ hazelcast-member start
ID:  confident_tharp
```
You can start as many members as you want and they will automatically form a cluster.

The name of the process (e.g., `confident_tharp` in the above example) is chosen randomly by the tool. As you start other members, you will see different names for each of them. This naming assignment is for your convenience.

You can see the information about your member, including its cluster's <<creating-cluster-groups, group name>>, IP address and port, using the `hazelcast-members logs` command. You will need these information when you want to connect your clients to this cluster. Note that, when you have more than one members, you need to give the assigned name of a member to see its logs, e.g., `hazelcast-member logs confident_tharp`.

The default configuration for the members is delivered within the `hazelcast-member` tool, i.e., `hazelcast.xml`. You can also pass a customized configuration.

See the <<hazelcast-member-tool, hazelcast-member appendix>> for information on the tool's installation and detailed usage.

Once your cluster of Hazelcast members is ready, you can connect to this cluster with your client applications. See the below section for an example.

=== Your First IMDG Application

The following is an example client application in Java language. This example client is first connecting to the Hazelcast cluster that you created with the `hazelcast-member` tool. Then, it creates a map and puts entries in it.

[source,java]
---- 
public class MyClient {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
       clientConfig.getGroupConfig().setName( "dev" );
       clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress( "10.216.1.68" );
       HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);

       IMap<Object, Object> myMap = client.getMap( "myMap" );

       for (int i = 0; i < 10_000; i++) {
           myMap.put(i, i);
       }

       System.out.println("Put operation is done");
   }
}
----

To connect to the cluster, you need to give the cluster's group name (`dev` in the above example) and the IP address of one of the members (`10.216.1.68` in the above example). You can learn these information using the `hazelcast-member logs` command as explained in the previous section. Then, you can create your map and perform your map operations (`put` in the above example). See the <<java-client, Java Client section>> for information on using the Java client with Hazelcast IMDG.

Besides Java, you can create client applications using the following language and implementations:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client[.NET]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client[C++]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client[Node.js]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client[Python]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client[Go]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-scala[Scala]

The above links take you to the respective client's GitHub repository and documentation. This manual also includes the <<hazelcast-clients, Hazelcast Clients chapter>> which presents brief descriptions of the above clients.

[[starting-the-member-and-client2]]
=== Starting the Member and Client

Having installed Hazelcast, you can get started.

In this short tutorial, you perform the following activities.

. Create a simple Java application using the Hazelcast distributed map and queue.
. Run our application twice to have a cluster with two members (JVMs).
. Connect to our cluster from another Java application by using the Hazelcast Native Java Client API.

Let's begin.


* The following code starts the first Hazelcast member and creates and uses the `customers` map and queue.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/GettingStartedMember.java[tag=startmember]
----
+
* Run this `GettingStarted` class a second time to get the second member
started. The members form a cluster and the output is similar to the following.
+
```
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080
]
```
+
Here, you can see the size of your cluster (`size`) and member list version (`ver`). The member list version will be incremented when changes happen to the cluster, e.g., a member leaving from or joining to the cluster.
+
The above member list format is introduced with Hazelcast 3.9. You can enable the legacy member list format,  which was used for the releases before Hazelcast 3.9, using the system property `hazelcast.legacy.memberlist.format.enabled`. See the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>>. The following is an example for the legacy member list format:
+
```
Members [2] {
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - c1ccc8d4-a549-4bff-bf46-9213e14a9fd2 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 33a82dbf-85d6-4780-b9cf-e47d42fb89d4
}
```
+
* Now, add the `hazelcast-client-`*`<version>`*`.jar` library to your classpath.
This is required to use a Hazelcast client.
* The following code starts a Hazelcast Client, connects to our cluster,
and prints the size of the `customers` map.
+
[source,java]
----
public class GettingStartedClient {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
        HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig );
        IMap map = client.getMap( "customers" );
        System.out.println( "Map Size:" + map.size() );
    }
}
----
+
* When you run it, you see the client properly connecting to the cluster
and printing the map size as **3**.

Hazelcast also offers a tool, **Management Center**, that enables you to monitor your cluster.
You can download it from Hazelcast website's https://hazelcast.org/download/#management-center[download page].
You can use it to monitor your maps, queues and other distributed data structures and members. Please
see the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html[Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual] for usage explanations.


By default, Hazelcast uses multicast to discover other members that can form a cluster.  If you are
working with other Hazelcast developers on the same network, you may find yourself joining their
clusters under the default settings.  Hazelcast provides a way to segregate clusters within the same
network when using multicast. See the <<creating-cluster-groups, Creating Cluster Groups section>>
for more information.  Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the default multicast mechanism,
you can provide a fixed list of IP addresses that are allowed to join. See
the <<join, Join configuration section>> for more information.

NOTE: Multicast mechanism is not recommended for production since UDP is often blocked in production environments and other discovery mechanisms are more definite. See the <<discovery-mechanisms, Discovery Mechanisms section>>.

NOTE: You can also check the video tutorials https://hazelcast.org/getting-started-with-hazelcast[here].

[[using-the-scripts-in-the-package]]
=== Using the Scripts In The Package

When you download and extract the Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ package, you will see the following scripts under the `/bin` folder that provide basic functionalities for member and cluster management.

The following are the names and descriptions of each script:

* `start.sh` / `start.bat`: Starts a Hazelcast member with default configuration in the working directory.
* `stop.sh` / `stop.bat`: Stops the Hazelcast member that was started in the current working directory.
* `cluster.sh`: Provides basic functionalities for cluster management, such as getting and changing the cluster state, shutting down the cluster or forcing the cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start. See the <<using-the-script-cluster-sh, Using the Script cluster.sh section>> to learn the usage of this script.


NOTE: `start.sh` / `start.bat` scripts lets you start one Hazelcast instance per folder. To start a new instance, please unzip Hazelcast ZIP or TAR.GZ package in a new folder.

NOTE: You can also use the start scripts to deploy your own library to a Hazelcast member. See the <<adding-user-library-to-classpath, Adding User Library to CLASSPATH section>>.

[[deploying-on-amazon-ec2]]
=== Deploying On Amazon EC2

You can deploy your Hazelcast project onto an Amazon EC2 environment using Third Party tools such as https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] and https://www.chef.io/chef/[Chef].

You can find a sample deployment project (`amazon-ec2-vagrant-chef`) with step-by-step instructions in the `hazelcast-integration` folder of the **hazelcast-code-samples** package, which you can download at https://hazelcast.org/download/[hazelcast.org]. See this sample project for more information.

[[deploying-on-microsoft-azure]]
=== Deploying On Microsoft Azure

image::Plugin_New.png[Azure Plugin, 84, 22]

You can deploy your Hazelcast cluster onto a Microsoft Azure environment. For this, your cluster should make use of Hazelcast Discovery Plugin for Microsoft Azure. You can find information about this plugin on its GitHub repository at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure].

For information on how to automatically deploy your cluster onto Azure, see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure/blob/master/README.md#automated-deployment[Deployment] section of https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure[Hazelcast Azure] plugin repository.

[[deploying-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]
=== Deploying On Pivotal Cloud Foundry

image::Plugin_New.png[CloudFoundry, 84, 22]

Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, you can deploy your Hazelcast cluster onto Pivotal Cloud Foundry. It is available as a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Tile which you can download at https://network.pivotal.io/products/hazelcast-pcf/[here]. You can find the installation and usage instructions and the release notes documents at https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/hazelcast/index.html[https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/hazelcast/index.html].

[[deploying-using-docker]]
=== Deploying using Docker

image::Plugin_New.png[Docker Plugin, 84, 22]

You can deploy your Hazelcast projects using the Docker containers. Hazelcast has the following images on Docker:

* Hazelcast IMDG
* Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise
* Hazelcast Management Center
* Hazelcast OpenShift

After you pull an image from the Docker registry, you can run your image to start the Management Center or a Hazelcast instance with Hazelcast's default configuration. All repositories provide the latest stable releases but you can pull a specific release too. You can also specify environment variables when running the image.

If you want to start a customized Hazelcast instance, you can extend the Hazelcast image by providing your own configuration file.

This feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. See its own GitHub repo at https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker[Hazelcast Docker] for details on configurations and usages.
