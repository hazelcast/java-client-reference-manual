== Introduction

Hazelcast Java client is the most full featured Hazelcast native client.
It is offered both with Hazelcast IMDG and Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.
The main idea behind the Java client is to provide the same
Hazelcast functionality by proxying each operation through a
Hazelcast member. It can access and change distributed data and
it can listen to the distributed events of an already established
Hazelcast cluster from another Java application.

Hundreds or even thousands of clients can be connected to the cluster.
By default, there are "core count * 20" threads on the server side that
handle all the requests, e.g., if the server has 4 cores, there will be 80 threads.
