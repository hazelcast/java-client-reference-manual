=== JCache API

This section explains the JCache API by providing simple
examples and use cases. While walking through the examples,
we will have
a look at a couple of the standard API classes and see
how these classes are used.

==== JCache API Application Example 

The code in this subsection creates a small account application
by providing a caching layer over an imagined database abstraction.
The database layer is simulated using a single demo data in a simple
DAO interface. To show the difference between the "database"
access and retrieving values from the cache, a small waiting time is
used in the DAO implementation to simulate network and
database latency.

===== Creating User Class Example

Before we implement the JCache caching layer, let's have a quick
look at some basic classes we need for this example.

The `User` class is the representation of a user table in the
database. To keep it simple, it has just two properties:
`userId` and `username`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/User.java[tag=user]
----

===== Creating DAO Interface Example

The DAO interface is also kept easy in this example.
It provides a simple method to retrieve (find) a user by its `userId`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/UserDao.java[tag=userdao]
----

===== Configuring JCache Example

To show most of the standard features, the configuration
example is a little more complex.

[source,java]
----
// Create javax.cache.configuration.CompleteConfiguration subclass
CompleteConfiguration<Integer, User> config =
    new MutableConfiguration<Integer, User>()
        // Configure the cache to be typesafe
        .setTypes( Integer.class, User.class )
        // Configure to expire entries 30 secs after creation in the cache
        .setExpiryPolicyFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf(
            new AccessedExpiryPolicy( new Duration( TimeUnit.SECONDS, 30 ) )
        ) )
        // Configure read-through of the underlying store
        .setReadThrough( true )
        // Configure write-through to the underlying store
        .setWriteThrough( true )
        // Configure the javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader
        .setCacheLoaderFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf(
            new UserCacheLoader( userDao )
        ) )
        // Configure the javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter
        .setCacheWriterFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf(
            new UserCacheWriter( userDao )
        ) )
        // Configure the javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener with no
        // javax.cache.event.CacheEntryEventFilter, to include old value
        // and to be executed synchronously
        .addCacheEntryListenerConfiguration(
            new MutableCacheEntryListenerConfiguration<Integer, User>(
                new UserCacheEntryListenerFactory(),
                null, true, true
            )
        );
----

Let's go through this configuration line by line.

====== Setting the Cache Type and Expire Policy

First, we set the expected types for the cache, which
is already known from the previous example. On the next line, a
`javax.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy` is configured.
Almost all integration `ExpiryPolicy` implementations are
configured using
`javax.cache.configuration.Factory` instances. `Factory` and
`FactoryBuilder` are explained later in this chapter.

====== Configuring Read-Through and Write-Through

The next two lines configure the thread that are read-through
and write-through to the underlying backend resource that is configured
over the next few lines. The JCache API offers `javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader`
and `javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter` to
implement adapter classes to any kind of backend resource, e.g., JPA, JDBC, or any
other backend technology implementable in Java.
The interface provides the typical CRUD operations like `create`, `get`,
`update`, `delete` and some bulk operation versions of those
common operations. We will look into the implementation of those implementations
later.

====== Configuring Entry Listeners

The last configuration setting defines entry listeners based on
sub-interfaces of `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener`. This
config does not use a `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryEventFilter`
since the listener is meant to be fired on every change that
happens on the cache. Again we will look in the implementation
of the listener in later in this chapter.

====== Full Example Code

A full running example that is presented in this
subsection is available in the
link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/jcache/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/examples/application[code samples repository^].
The application is built to be a command line app. It
offers a small shell to accept different commands. After startup, you can
enter `help` to see all available commands and their descriptions.

==== JCache Base Classes

In the <<example-jcache-application, Example JCache Application section>>,
we have already seen a couple of the base classes and explained how
those work. The following are quick descriptions of them:

**`javax.cache.Caching`**:

The access point into the JCache API. It retrieves the general
`CachingProvider` backed by any compliant JCache
implementation, such as Hazelcast JCache.

**`javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`**:

The SPI that is implemented to bridge between the JCache API and
the implementation itself. Hazelcast members and clients use different
providers chosen as seen in the <<configuring-jcache-provider,
Configuring JCache Provider section>> which enable the JCache API to
interact with Hazelcast clusters.

When a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider.getCacheManager()` overload
that takes a `java.lang.ClassLoader` argument is used, this
classloader will be a part of the scope of the created `java.cache.Cache`,
and it is not possible to retrieve it on other members.
We advise not to use those overloads, as they are not meant to be used
in distributed environments!

**`javax.cache.CacheManager`**:

The `CacheManager` provides the capability to create new and
manage existing JCache caches.

NOTE: A `javax.cache.Cache` instance created with key and
value types in the configuration
provides a type checking of those types at retrieval of the
cache. For that reason, all non-types retrieval methods like
`getCache` throw an exception because types cannot be checked.

**`javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`**, **`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration`**:

These two classes are used to configure a cache prior to
retrieving it from a `CacheManager`. The `Configuration` interface,
therefore, acts as a common super type for all compatible
configuration classes such as `MutableConfiguration`.

Hazelcast itself offers a special implementation
(`com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig`) of the `Configuration` interface
which offers more options on the specific Hazelcast properties
that can be set to configure features like synchronous and asynchronous
backups counts or selecting the underlying <<setting-in-memory-format,
in-memory format>> of the cache. For more information on this
configuration class, see the reference in the <<jcache-programmatic-configuration,
JCache Programmatic Configuration section>>.

**`javax.cache.Cache`**:

This interface represents the cache instance itself.
It is comparable to `java.util.Map` but offers special operations dedicated
to the caching use case. Therefore, for example `javax.cache.Cache.put()`,
unlike `java.util.Map.put()`, does not return the old
value previously assigned to the given key.


NOTE: Bulk operations on the `Cache` interface guarantee atomicity
per entry but not over
all given keys in the same bulk operations since no transactional
behavior is applied over the whole batch process.

==== Implementing Factory and FactoryBuilder

The `javax.cache.configuration.Factory` implementations configure
features like `CacheEntryListener`, `ExpiryPolicy` and ``CacheLoader``s or ``CacheWriter``s.
These factory implementations are required to distribute the
different features to members in a cluster environment like Hazelcast.
Therefore, these factory implementations have to be serializable.

`Factory` implementations are easy to do, as they follow the default
Provider- or Factory-Pattern. The example class
`UserCacheEntryListenerFactory` shown below implements a custom JCache `Factory`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/UserCacheEntryListenerFactory.java[tag=ucelf]
----


To simplify the process for the users, JCache API offers a set of
helper methods collected in `javax.cache.
configuration.FactoryBuilder`. In the above configuration
example, `FactoryBuilder.factoryOf()` creates a
singleton factory for the given instance.


==== Implementing CacheLoader

`javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader` loads cache entries
from any external backend resource. 

===== Cache read-through 

If the cache is
configured to be `read-through`, then `CacheLoader.load()`
is called transparently from the cache when the key or the value is not
yet found in the cache. If no value is found for a given key, it returns null.

If the cache is not configured to be `read-through`, nothing is
loaded automatically. The user code must call
`javax.cache.Cache.loadAll()` to load data for the given
set of keys into the cache.

For the bulk load operation (`loadAll()`), some keys may not
be found in the returned result set. In this case, a
`javax.cache.integration.CompletionListener` parameter can be used
as an asynchronous callback after all the key-value pairs are loaded
because loading many key-value pairs can take lots of time.

===== CacheLoader Example

Let's look at the `UserCacheLoader` implementation.
This implementation is quite straight forward.

* It implements `CacheLoader`.
* It overrides the `load` method to compute or retrieve
the value corresponding to `key`.
* It overrides the `loadAll` method to compute or
retrieve the values corresponding to `keys`.

An important note is that
any kind of exception has to be wrapped into
`javax.cache.integration.CacheLoaderException`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/UserCacheLoader.java[tag=ucl]
----

==== CacheWriter

You use a `javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter` to update
an external backend resource. If the cache is configured to be
`write-through`, this process is executed transparently to
the user's code. Otherwise, there is currently no way to trigger
writing changed entries to the external resource to a user-defined
point in time.

If bulk operations throw an exception, `java.util.Collection`
has to be cleaned of all successfully written keys so
the cache implementation can determine what keys are written
and can be applied to the cache state.

The following example performs the following tasks:

* It implements `CacheWriter`.
* It overrides the `write` method to write the specified
entry to the underlying store.
* It overrides the `writeAll` method to write the specified
entires to the underlying store.
* It overrides the `delete` method to delete the key entry
from the store.
* It overrides the `deleteAll` method to delete the data and
keys from the underlying store for the given collection of keys, if present.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/UserCacheWriter.java[tag=ucw]
----

Again, the implementation is pretty straightforward and
also as above all exceptions thrown by the external resource,
like `java.sql.SQLException` has to be wrapped into a
`javax.cache.integration.CacheWriterException`. Note this is a different
exception from the one thrown by `CacheLoader`.

==== Implementing EntryProcessor

With `javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessor`, you can apply an
atomic function to a cache entry. In a distributed
environment like Hazelcast, you can move the mutating function
to the member that owns the key. If the value
object is big, it might prevent traffic by sending the object
to the mutator and sending it back to the owner to update it.

By default, Hazelcast JCache sends the complete changed value
to the backup partition. Again, this can cause a lot of traffic if
the object is big. The Hazelcast ICache extension can also prevent this.
Further information is available at
<<implementing-backupawareentryprocessor, Implementing BackupAwareEntryProcessor>>.

An arbitrary number of arguments can be passed to the
`Cache.invoke()` and `Cache.invokeAll()` methods. All of those
arguments need
to be fully serializable because in a distributed environment
like Hazelcast, it is very likely that these arguments have to be passed around the cluster.

The following example performs the following tasks.

* It implements `EntryProcessor`.
* It overrides the `process` method to process an entry.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/UserUpdateEntryProcessor.java[tag=uuep]
----

NOTE: By executing the bulk `Cache.invokeAll()` operation,
atomicity is only guaranteed for a
single cache entry. No transactional rules are applied to the bulk operation.

NOTE: JCache `EntryProcessor` implementations are not allowed to call
`javax.cache.Cache` methods. This prevents operations from
deadlocking between different calls.

In addition, when using a `Cache.invokeAll()` method, a
`java.util.Map` is returned that maps the key to its
`javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessorResult`, which itself
wraps the actual result or a thrown
`javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessorException`.

==== CacheEntryListener

The `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener` implementation is
straight forward. `CacheEntryListener` is a super-interface that
is used as a marker for listener classes in JCache. The specification
brings a set of sub-interfaces.

* `CacheEntryCreatedListener`: Fires after a cache entry is
added (even on read-through by a `CacheLoader`) to the cache.
* `CacheEntryUpdatedListener`: Fires after an already existing
cache entry updates.
* `CacheEntryRemovedListener`: Fires after a cache entry
was removed (not expired) from the cache.
* `CacheEntryExpiredListener`: Fires after a cache entry
has been expired. Expiry does not have to be a parallel
process-- Hazelcast JCache implementation detects and
removes expired entries periodically. Therefore, the expiration
event may not be fired as soon as the entry expires.
See <<ExpiryPolicy>> for details.

To configure `CacheEntryListener`, add a
`javax.cache.configuration.CacheEntryListenerConfiguration` instance to
the JCache configuration class, as seen in the above example
configuration. In addition, listeners can be configured to be
executed synchronously (blocking the calling thread) or asynchronously
(fully running in parallel).

In this example application, the listener is implemented to
print event information on the console. That visualizes what is
going on in the cache. This application performs the following tasks:

* It implements the `CacheEntryCreatedListener.onCreated` method
to call after an entry is created.
* It implements the `CacheEntryUpdatedListener.onUpdated` method
to call after an entry is updated.
* It implements the `CacheEntryRemovedListener.onRemoved` method
to call after an entry is removed.
* It implements the `CacheEntryExpiredListener.onExpired` method
to call after an entry expires.
* It implements `printEvents` to print event information on the
console.

==== ExpiryPolicy

In JCache, `javax.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy` implementations are
used to automatically expire cache entries based on different rules.

JCache does not require expired entries to be removed from the cache
immediately. It only enforces that expired entries are not returned from cache.
Therefore, exact time of removal is implementation specific.
Hazelcast complies JCache by checking the entries for expiration
at the time of
get operations (lazy expiration). In addition to that, Hazelcast
uses a periodic task to detect and remove expired entries as soon as possible
(eager expiration).
Thanks to eager expiry, all expired entries are removed from the memory
eventually even when they are not touched again. So the space
used by such entries are released as well.

For a detailed explanation of interaction between expiry policies and
JCache API, see the table in the `Expiry Policies` section of
link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JCache documentation^].

Expiry timeouts are defined using `javax.cache.expiry.Duration`,
which is a pair of `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit`, that
describes a time unit and a long, defining the timeout value.
The minimum allowed `TimeUnit` is `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`.
The long value `durationAmount` must be equal or greater than zero.
A value of zero (or `Duration.ZERO`) indicates that the
cache entry expires immediately.

By default, JCache delivers a set of predefined expiry strategies
in the standard API.

* `AccessedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured
from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on accessing the key.
* `CreatedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured
from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is never updated.
* `EternalExpiryPolicy`: Never expires. This is the default behavior,
similar to `ExpiryPolicy` being set to null.
* `ModifiedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured
from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on updating the key.
* `TouchedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured
from creation of the cache entry. The expiry timeout is updated on accessing or updating the key.

Because `EternalExpiryPolicy` does not expire cache entries,
it is still possible to evict values from memory if an underlying
`CacheLoader` is defined.
