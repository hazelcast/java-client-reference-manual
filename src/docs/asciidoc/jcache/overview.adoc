=== JCache Overview

Hazelcast offers a specification-compliant JCache implementation.
To show our commitment to this
important specification that the Java world was waiting for
over a decade, we did not just provide a simple wrapper around our existing
APIs; we implemented a caching structure from the ground up
to optimize the behavior to the needs of JCache.
The Hazelcast JCache implementation is 100% TCK (Technology
Compatibility Kit) compliant and therefore passes all specification
requirements.

In addition to the given specification, we added some
features like asynchronous versions of almost all
operations to give the user extra power.

This chapter gives a basic understanding of how to
configure your application and how to setup Hazelcast
to be your JCache
provider. It also shows examples of basic JCache usage
as well as the additionally offered features that are
not part of JSR-107.
To gain a full understanding of the JCache functionality
and provided guarantees of different operations, read
the specification document (which is also the main
documentation for functionality) at the specification
page of link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107^].

==== Supported JCache Versions

The following versions of the JCache specification
have been released:

* The original release, version 1.0.0, was released
in March 2014. Hazelcast versions 3.3.1 up to 3.9.2
(included) implement version 1.0.0 of the JCache specification.
* A maintenance release, version 1.1.0 was released
in December 2017. Hazelcast version 3.9.3 and higher
implement JCache specification version 1.1.0.
* A patch release, version 1.1.1 was released in
May 2019. Hazelcast version 3.12.1 and higher implement JCache 1.1.1.

JCache 1.1.x versions are backwards compatible with
JCache 1.0.0. As maintenance releases, JCache 1.1.x versions
introduce clarifications and bug fixes in the specification, reference implementation
and TCK, without introducing any additional features.

==== Upgrading from JCache 1.1.0 to 1.1.1

JCache 1.1.1 is a bug-fix-only release. There are no
behavioral differences between the JCache 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 specifications.

==== Upgrading from JCache 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

When upgrading from a Hazelcast version which implements
JCache 1.0.0 to a version that implements version 1.1.0
of the specification, some behavioral differences must be taken into account:

* Invoking `CacheManager.getCacheNames` on a closed
`CacheManager` returns an empty iterator under JCache 1.0.0.
While under JCache 1.1.0, it throws `IllegalStateException`.
* Runtime type checking is removed from `CacheManager.getCache(String)`,
so when using JCache 1.1.0 one may obtain a `Cache` by name
even when its configured key/value types are not known.
* Statistics effects of `Cache.putIfAbsent` on misses and
hits are properly applied when using JCache 1.1.0, while
under JCache 1.0.0 misses and hits were not updated.

Note that these behavioral differences apply on the Hazelcast
member that executes the operation. Thus when performing a
rolling member upgrade from a JCache 1.0.0-compliant Hazelcast
version to a newer Hazelcast version that supports JCache 1.1.0,
operations executed on the new members exhibit JCache 1.1.0
behavior while those executed on old members implement
JCache 1.0.0 behavior.

version 1.1.0 is link:https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec/milestone/2?closed=1[available on Github^].
