=== JCache Providers

Use JCache providers to create caches for a
specification compliant implementation. Those
providers abstract the platform
specific behavior and bindings and provide the
different JCache required features.

Hazelcast has two types of providers. Depending on your
application setup and the cluster topology,
you can use the Client Provider (used by Hazelcast clients)
or the Server Provider (used by cluster members).

For more information on cluster topologies and Hazelcast
clients, see the <<hazelcast-topology, Hazelcast Topology section>>.

==== Configuring JCache Provider

Configure the JCache `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`
by either specifying the provider at the command line or
by declaring the provider inside the Hazelcast configuration XML file.
For more information on setting properties in this XML
configuration file, see the <<jcache-declarative-configuration,
JCache Declarative Configuration section>>.

Hazelcast implements a delegating `CachingProvider` that can
automatically be configured for either client or member mode and that
delegates to the real underlying implementation based on the
user's choice. Hazelcast recommends that you use this `CachingProvider`
implementation.

The delegating `CachingProvider`s fully qualified class name is

```
com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCachingProvider
```

To configure the delegating provider at the command line,
add the following parameter to the Java startup call,
depending on the chosen provider:

```
-Dhazelcast.jcache.provider.type=[client|server]
```

By default, the delegating `CachingProvider` is automatically
picked up by the JCache SPI and provided as shown above.
In cases where multiple `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`
implementations reside on the classpath (like in some Application
Server scenarios), you can select a `CachingProvider` by explicitly
calling `Caching.getCachingProvider()`
overloads and providing them using the canonical class name of
the provider to be used. The class names of member and client providers
provided by Hazelcast are mentioned in the following two subsections.

NOTE: Hazelcast advises that you use the `Caching.getCachingProvider()` overloads to select a
`CachingProvider` explicitly. This ensures that uploading to later
environments or Application Server versions doesn't result in unexpected
behavior like choosing a wrong `CachingProvider`.

==== Configuring JCache with Client Provider

For cluster topologies where Hazelcast light clients are used to
connect to a remote Hazelcast cluster, use the Client Provider to
configure JCache.

The Client Provider provides the same features as the Server Provider.
However, it does not hold data on its own but instead delegates requests
and calls to the remotely connected cluster.

The Client Provider can connect to multiple clusters at the same time.
This can be achieved by scoping the client side
`CacheManager` with different Hazelcast configuration files.
For more information, see
<<scoping-to-join-clusters, Scoping to Join Clusters>>.

To request this `CachingProvider` using `Caching.getCachingProvider( String )` or
`Caching.getCachingProvider( String, ClassLoader )`, use the
following fully qualified class name:

```
com.hazelcast.client.cache.impl.HazelcastClientCachingProvider
```

==== Configuring JCache with Server Provider

If a Hazelcast member is embedded into an application directly
and the Hazelcast client is not used, the Server Provider is
required. In this case, the member itself becomes a part of
the distributed cache and requests and operations are distributed
directly across the cluster by its given key.

The Server Provider provides the same features as the Client
provider, but it keeps data in the local Hazelcast member and also distributes
non-owned keys to other direct cluster members.

Like the Client Provider, the Server Provider can connect to
multiple clusters at the same time. This can be achieved by
scoping the client side `CacheManager` with different Hazelcast
configuration files. For more
information, see <<scoping-to-join-clusters, Scoping to Join Clusters>>.

To request this `CachingProvider` using `Caching.getCachingProvider( String )` or
`Caching.getCachingProvider( String, ClassLoader )`, use the
following fully qualified class name:

```
com.hazelcast.cache.impl.HazelcastServerCachingProvider
```
