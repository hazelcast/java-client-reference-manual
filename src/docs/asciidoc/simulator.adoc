== Hazelcast Simulator

Hazelcast Simulator is a production simulator used to test Hazelcast and Hazelcast-based applications in clustered environments. It also allows you to create your own tests and perform them on your Hazelcast clusters and applications that are deployed to cloud computing environments. In your tests, you can provide any property that can be specified on these environments (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine(GCE), or your own environment): properties such as hardware specifications, operating system and Java version.

See the documentation on its own GitHub repository at link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-simulator/blob/master/README.md[Hazelcast Simulator^].
